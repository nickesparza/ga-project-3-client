## General Approach
Patient data is seeded in the mongoDB server according to the patient model. After that, the data can be manipulated by authenticated users inside the client.

We are using React with functional components for the frontend client application, and Express with Mongoose to connect to the MongoDB server on the backend.

## Installation Instructions
You need to install dependencies with `npm install`.
After that, `npm start` will launch both the mongoDB server and the react client.
